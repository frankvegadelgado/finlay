    <h1>Triangle-Free Problem</h1>
    <p>
      The Triangle-Free problem is a fundamental decision problem in graph
      theory. Given an undirected graph, the problem asks whether it's possible
      to determine if the graph contains no triangles (cycles of length 3). In
      other words, it checks if there exists a configuration where no three
      vertices are connected by edges that form a closed triangle.
    </p>
    <p>This problem is important for various reasons:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Graph Analysis:</strong> It's a basic building block for more
        complex graph algorithms and has applications in social network
        analysis, web graph analysis, and other domains.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Computational Complexity:</strong> It serves as a benchmark
        problem in the study of efficient algorithms for graph properties. While
        the naive approach has a time complexity of $O(n^3)$, there are more
        efficient algorithms with subcubic complexity.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Understanding the Triangle-Free problem is essential for anyone working
      with graphs and graph algorithms.

    <h1>Our Algorithm - Runtime $O(n + m)$</h1>
    <h2>The algorithm explanation:</h2>
    <p>
      We detect triangles in a graph using a depth-first search (DFS) and a
      coloring scheme. During the DFS traversal, each visited node assigns
      unique, consecutive integer colors to its uncolored neighbors.
      Specifically, if a node assigns color $c$ to one neighbor, this neighbor
      assigns $c+1$ to the next, and so on. A triangle exists if two adjacent
      nodes share two colored neighbors, and the colors assigned to these shared
      neighbors differ by exactly two.
    </p>
    <h2>Runtime Analysis:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <em>Depth-First Search (DFS)</em>: A standard depth-first search (DFS)
        on a graph with $\mid V \mid$ vertices and $\mid E \mid$ edges has a
        time complexity of $O(\mid V \mid + \mid E \mid)$, where $\mid \ldots
        \mid$ represents the cardinality (e.g., $n = \mid V \mid$ and $m = \mid
        E \mid$). This is because in the worst case, we visit every vertex and
        explore every edge.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>Coloring and Checking for Color Difference:</em> In the Depth-First
        Search (DFS), each node performs either color assignment or a
        constant-time check of color differences with its neighbors. Because
        this operation is executed for every vertex during the DFS traversal,
        the overall computational complexity remains equivalent to the standard
        DFS algorithm's worst-case running time.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>Overall Runtime:</em> The combined depth-first search, coloring, and
        checking process has a time complexity of $O(\mid V \mid + \mid E
        \mid)$.
      </li>

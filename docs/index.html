    <h1>Triangle-Free Problem</h1>
    <p>
      The Triangle-Free problem is a fundamental decision problem in graph
      theory. Given an undirected graph, the problem asks whether it's possible
      to determine if the graph contains no triangles (cycles of length 3). In
      other words, it checks if there exists a configuration where no three
      vertices are connected by edges that form a closed triangle.
    </p>
    <p>This problem is important for various reasons:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Graph Analysis:</strong> It's a basic building block for more
        complex graph algorithms and has applications in social network
        analysis, web graph analysis, and other domains.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Computational Complexity:</strong> It serves as a benchmark
        problem in the study of efficient algorithms for graph properties. While
        the naive approach has a time complexity of $O(n^3)$, there are more
        efficient algorithms with subcubic complexity.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Understanding the Triangle-Free problem is essential for anyone working
      with graphs and graph algorithms.

    <h1>Our Algorithm - Runtime $O(n + m)$</h1>
    <h2>The algorithm explanation:</h2>
    <p>
      We detect triangles in a graph using a depth-first search (DFS) and a
      coloring scheme. During the DFS traversal, each visited node assigns
      unique, consecutive integer colors to its uncolored neighbors. A triangle
      exists if two adjacent nodes share two colored neighbors, and the colors
      assigned to these shared neighbors differ by exactly two.
    </p>
    <h2>Runtime Analysis:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <em>Depth-First Search (DFS)</em>: A standard depth-first search (DFS)
        on a graph with $\mid V \mid$ vertices and $\mid E \mid$ edges has a
        time complexity of $O(\mid V \mid + \mid E \mid)$, where $\mid \ldots
        \mid$ represents the cardinality (e.g., $n = \mid V \mid$ and $m = \mid
        E \mid$). This is because in the worst case, we visit every vertex and
        explore every edge.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>Coloring and Checking for Color Difference:</em> In the Depth-First
        Search (DFS), each node performs either color assignment or a
        constant-time check of color differences with its neighbors. Because
        this operation is executed for every vertex during the DFS traversal,
        the overall computational complexity remains equivalent to the standard
        DFS algorithm's worst-case running time.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>Overall Runtime:</em> The combined depth-first search, coloring, and
        checking process has a time complexity of $O(\mid V \mid + \mid E
        \mid)$.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h1>Execute</h1>
    <hr />
    <ol>
      <li>Go to the package directory to use the benchmarks:</li>
    </ol>
    <pre><code class="language-bash">git clone https://github.com/frankvegadelgado/finlay.git
cd finlay
</code></pre>
    <ol start="2">
      <li>Execute the script:</li>
    </ol>
    <pre><code class="language-bash">triangle -i .\benchmarks\testMatrix1.txt
</code></pre>
    <p>
      utilizing the <code>triangle</code> command provided by Aegypti's Library
      to execute the Boolean adjacency matrix
      <code>finlay\benchmarks\testMatrix1.txt</code>. The file
      <code>testMatrix1.txt</code> represents the example described herein. We
      also support .xz, .lzma, .bz2, and .bzip2 compressed .txt files.
    </p>
    <h2>The console output will display:</h2>
    <pre><code>testMatrix1.txt: Triangle Found (4, 0, 2)
</code></pre>
    <p>
      which implies that the Boolean adjacency matrix
      <code>finlay\benchmarks\testMatrix1.txt</code> contains a triangle
      combining the coordinates <code>(4, 0, 2)</code>.
    </p>
    <h2>Finding All Triangles - Runtime $O(n + m)$</h2>
    <p>
      The <code>-a</code> flag enables the discovery of all triangles within the
      graph.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
    <pre><code class="language-bash">triangle -i .\benchmarks\testMatrix2.txt -a
</code></pre>
    <p><strong>Output:</strong></p>
    <pre><code>testMatrix2.txt: Triangles Found (3, 4), (2, 8), (1, 8), (3, 10), (0, 3), (0, 2), (0, 1)
</code></pre>
    <p>
      When multiple triangles exist, the output provides a list of their
      vertices.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Vertex Representation:</strong></p>
    <p>
      Each vertex pair in the list represents a triangle, possibly with
      repetitions. The remaining vertex for each triangle can be determined by
      referring to the adjacency matrix.
    </p>
    <h3>Runtime Analysis (Find All Triangles)</h3>
    <p>The runtime complexity remains <strong>O(n + m)</strong>, where:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>n</strong> represents the number of nodes in the graph.</li>
      <li><strong>m</strong> represents the number of edges in the graph.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This is because the algorithm primarily relies on a Depth-First Search
      (DFS) traversal of the graph.
    </p>
    <h1>Command Options</h1>

  -n NUM_TESTS, --num_tests NUM_TESTS
                        An integer specifying the number of random matrix tests.
  -s SPARSITY, --sparsity SPARSITY
                        Sparsity of the matrix (0.0 for dense, close to 1.0 for very sparse).

      This tool is designed to perform tests on randomly generated square
      matrices of varying sparsity. The options allow users to control the
      matrix dimensions, the number of tests to run, and the matrix sparsity. In
      additon, the random matrix can be written to the directory from which the
      command is run. File logging can also be enabled.
